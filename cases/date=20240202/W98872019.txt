JUSTICE SURESH KUMAR KAIT HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA JUDGMENT SURESH KUMAR KAIT, J 1. The petitioner-organisation, claims to be a registered organization, working to provide a platform to whistleblowers across the country and to take up litigation on their behalf in order to provide them anonymity and to instill in them the necessary confidence to make disclosures without fear, arrange for their objective and impartial investigation and help to take such cases to their logical conclusions in a time bound manner. 2. The petitioner has filed the instant writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India seeking direction for an in-depth, thorough and time bound investigation by a SIT into various serious illegalities, violations and siphoning of funds committed by the promoters of Indiabulls Housing Finance Limited (IBHFL), its subsidiaries and their promoters. The petitioner has further sought directions to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Registrar of Companies (ROC), Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO), National Housing Bank (NHB), Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to take action against IBHFL and its promoters/owners, who through its promoters, subsidiary companies and various group of companies, has been advancing dubious loans to companies owned by large corporate groups which in turn have been routing the money back to the accounts of companies owned by the promoters of Indiabulls, so as to increase their personal wealth. 3. The petitioner alleged that the aforesaid activities of respondent No.7-India Bulls Housing Finance Ltd. and its promoters are in violation of various Statutes and Polices relating to Companies Act, 2013, Rules and Regulations of Reserve Bank of India (RBI), SEBI, National Housing Bank and other laws. 4. The petitioner further alleged that the respondent No.7 and the companies owned by its promoters have been involved in round tripping of funds in violation of the relevant laws and policy guidelines and they have also not disclosed sources thereof and their books of account also do not show the true state of affairs. However, the authorities concerned have failed to do any investigation into these allegations/reports and take required action against them, which poses serious risk and threat to the public interest. 5. The petitioner has also alleged that the respondent - IBHFL group, and the group of companies owned by it i.e. India Bulls Real Estate, Indiabulls Commercial Credit, Indiabulls Ventures, Indiabulls Infra &Power and scores of other privately held companies, with their ownership divided between the partners, has a net worth of over Rs.75,838/- crores, as per its website. 6. According to the petitioner, the IBHFL group of companies has 220 branches in 100 cities across India, which is regulated by the National Housing Bank (NHB). IBHFL contributes 80% of the Indiabulls group's turnover and in the fiscal year 2017-18, it had disbursed loans totaling to a sum of Rs.1,22,578/-. 7. The petitioner has further alleged that IBHFL has extended huge loans to various companies and these companies in turn are routing a substantial part of the money back as investment in equities to companies apparently belonging to the key-shareholders/promoters of IBHFL including Sameer Gehlaut, the founder and Chairman of IBHFL and his family members and thereby, the borrowing companies bestow huge benefits to the key shareholders and Chairman of IBHFL for the favour they get in the form of loans from IBHFL. 8. The petitioner also alleged that a substantial part of the money loaned by IBHFL to various companies has been invested/ploughed back into companies owned by promoters/owners of Indiabulls, either directly or indirectly through subsidiaries. The intent of all these methods is to create private wealth out of public money. The manner in which Indiabull group of companies is manipulating the funds, has been narrated by the petitioner, which is as under: a. By investing in Preference Shares of IB group subsidiaries. b. By investing Compulsory Convertible Debentures. These debentures have been issued to the investing companies at a rate of interest of 0.01%. c. By receipt of Mobilization Advance paid to a contractor for mobilization of resources for a project. 9. The petitioner alleged that even though few of the companies belonging to IBHFL did not have any fixed assets or not even involved in any business activity still they have extended small paid-up capital loans. Even the Directors and their office addresses are also common. 10. Petitioner has averred that the Companies Act, 2013 defines 'charge' as an interest or lien, created on the property or assets of a company or any of its undertakings or both as security and includes a mortgage. It is the duty of every company to register with the Registrar of Companies the specific 'charge' created by the company on its assets in public domain details of those who contemplate to give credit to a company to know how the property of the company is encumbered. 11. Reliance is placed upon Section 77 of the Companies Act, 2013 to submit that borrowing companies are required to file 'Charge' document with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs showing the amount borrowed and the security given to the lender company, within 30 days of its transaction. The said Section reads as under: "77.

(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, no charge created by a company shall be taken into account by the liquidator [appointed under this Act or the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (31 of 2016), as the case may be,] or any other creditor unless it is duly registered under sub-section (1) and a certificate of registration of such charge is given by the Registrar under sub-section (2). (4) Nothing in sub-section (3) shall prejudice any contract or obligation for the repayment of the money secured by a charge." 12.

The petitioner has alleged that none of these companies filed 'Charges' with the MCA and for many of these companies, ownership was transferred after availing the loans, even to some employees. Thereby attempts have been made to omit the name of IBHFL in the balance-sheets. Petitioner also stated that one of the Vatika Group Companies, namely, Agnes Developers has invested back in Karkinos Constructions which is 100 percent owned by Sameer Gehlaut. Petitioner has alleged that Karnikos Constructions received Rs.200/- crores from Agnes Developers owned by Vatika Group Companies in the form of debentures and has also received a substantial amount in the form of loan from IBHFL but this company has filed no 'Charge' with the MCA. Petitioner also pointed out that Karnikos Constructions has no significant asset and as per balance-sheets pertaining to the year 2017-18, has recorded Rs.724 crores in security deposit under the head 'Long Term Loan' which is a clear deviation from the standard accounting procedure. Petitioner averred that security deposit is purely an accommodation entry to avoid disclosure of terms of loan and identical interest. V. DLF Group Companies: Petitioner alleged that IBHFL has given loan of more than Rs.1705.54 crores in 48 companies owned by DLF Group Companies which is promoted by K.P.Singh. Petitioner also alleged that most of these companies have negative worth and have not filed any charge with the MCA.

During the course of hearing, learned counsel appearing on behalf of petitioner alleged that various irregularities have been committed by the companies promoted by the Indiabulls Group, primarily ploughing away public money into private equity by issuing compulsory convertible debentures and even though these instruments are not generally redeemable, however, the Indiabulls Group of Companies has promoted redemption thereon. It has been alleged that the amount worth thousands of crores is involved in the malpractices adopted by these companies. 15. Learned counsel relied upon afore-noted table to show that company has received Rs. 726.50 crore, from Reliance Corporate, Myrina Real Estate and Iphito Real Estate (Rs. 50 crore, Rs. 589 crore and Rs. 87.5 crore, respectively). According to petitioner, the loan from Reliance Corporate Advisory, is in the form of debentures carrying 0.01% interest per annum. The loan is secured by hypothecation of current assets. However, Galax Minerals' books of accounts show there are no current assets or insignificant current assets available except for investment which is not charged. Thus, the security is an eye wash leading one to conclude that the transaction is round tripping and accommodation entry. 16. The petitioner has alleged that some other companies where malpractices are apparent are:- Myrina Real Estate:- The fund invested by Myrina Real Estate is from the following sources: Sr.No. Name of the Company Instrument/Mode Investments (Rs. in crore) (31 Mar 2018) Remarks 1.

EMU Construction Pvt. Ltd. 0.01% Debentures 56.39 Total 1017.77 The petitioner has alleged that a huge sum of Rs.1,142/- crore was used out of capital resources raised by shares of IBHFL and Indiabulls Real Estate and make investments in other subsidiary companies through Myrina Real Estate, even though this company has no work history of the past and the transactions were sham and were made with the mala fide intent to fight levy of interest or to fight disclosure of name in the financial statement. Besides, the petitioner has also alleged that Myrina Real Estate is owned subsidiary of EMU Construction, which is owned by Sameer Gehlaut through Mugwort Real Estate Limited. To demonstrate the chain of group of companies owned by Indiabulls, the petitioner has shown it through the following flow chart:- Myrina Builders:- The company is a fully owned subsidiary of EMU Construction, which in turn is owned by Sameer Gehlaut through Mugwort Real EstateLimited. Attention of this Court was drawn to the chart Annexure P64. To show that investment of about Rs.614/- crores in India Best Buy flowing of money to and fro from Myrina Builders Pvt. Ltd. 17.

The proceeds of mobilised advance have been used to acquire equity shares of Gloxina Infrastructure, EMU Construction and Keysha Mining. Petitioner has averred that all these companies are owned and managed by Sameer Gehlaut. 18. Petitioner has alleged that in July, 2016, the Income Tax Department had carried out massive raids in the premises of Indiabulls and its companies located in Mumbai and Delhi and in the year 2019, directed Indiabulls to pay Rs.3 crores as tax and interest charges on the undisclosed income. Reliance is placed upon news report dated 14.06.2019 published in Business Standard (Annexure P-67). Petitioner alleged that in December, 2018, the Indiabulls had settled a few cases before SEBI and paid Rs.48 lakhs as settlement fees. To submit so, reliance is placed on news report published in Economic Times (Annexure P-68). 19. According to petitioner, in terms of Housing Finance Companies - Corporate Governance (National Housing Bank) Directions, 2016, all housing finance companies shall disclose transparently the loans advanced, to enable the National Housing Board to regulate housing finance system in the country. The petitioner is aggrieved that in terms of aforesaid directions, the Central Government, the Registrar of Companies or the Ministry of Corporate Affairs ought to have filed a complaint and taken action on the violation of Sections 77 and 86 of Companies Act, 2013. 20. Petitioner also alleged that the Central Government should have entrusted the investigation of the questionable details of IBHFL to the SFIO. Also the National Housing Bank under the National Housing Bank Act, 1987 ought to have exercised its power to inspect the reports and to collect information from housing finance companies. 21. Petitioner has further alleged that the National Housing Board ought to have directed for a special audit of the accounts of IBHFL as envisaged in Section 33 of National Housing Bank Act, 1987 and the irregularities should have been pointed out and a complaint under Section 50 of the Act should have been made. Also, SEBI should have taken action under Sections 11, 11A, 11B, 11C and 11D to investigate the affairs of the IBHFL. Hence, the petitioner has prayed that since these authorities have failed to take requisite action against Indiabulls, its subsidiary companies as well as group of companies, to ensure a corruption free society, a time-bund investigation by SIT, comprising expert members, be directed. 22. A prayer is also made to direct the Ministry of Corporate Affairs to conduct a fair investigation through the SFIO into the irregularities committed by Indiabulls and companies.

Therefore, the Reserve Bank in exercise of its powers under Section 45 NC of the Reserve Bank of India Act, by notification dated 15.11.1997 had exempted housing finance institutions from the provisions of Chapter III B of the Reserve Bank of India Act. The Finance Act (2) of 2019 (Act 23 of 2019) has since amended the National Housing Bank Act, 1987 specifically conferring certain powers on the Reserve Bank of India in respect of housing finance institutions and these provisions of the Finance Act amending the NHB Act has come into force with effect from 09.08.2019.

Agnes Developers, one of the Vatika Group companies, ploughed back Rs. 400 crores in Karkinos Constructions and India Best Buy in 2014-15 in the form of debentures. V. Similarly, IBHFL has put in more than Rs. 1705 crore in 48 companies of DLF Group, many of which have negative worth." 44. For alleging the afore-noted siphoning of funds by the IBHFL and other Indiabull group of companies, the petitioner has relied upon news report dated 14.06.2019 published in Business Standard and news report published in December, 2018 in Economic Times, to submit that in July, 2016, the Income Tax Department had carried out massive raids in the premises of Indiabulls and its companies located in Mumbai and Delhi and directed Indiabulls to pay Rs.3 crores as tax and interest charges on the undisclosed income in the year 2019. Petitioner has alleged that in December, 2018, the Indiabulls had settled a few cases before SEBI and paid Rs.48 lakhs as settlement fees. 45. It is relevant to note here that the Business Standard in respect of its article published on 15.10.2019, has acceded that the contents of the Article were erroneous. Vide letter dated 18.10.2019 written to the Advocate of respondent, it sought to clarify stating as under:- "Dated: October 18, 2019 To, Mr. Rishi Agarwala Agarwal Law Associates Advocates Supreme Court 19, Babar Road, Bengali Market, New Delhi-110001 Also At: Chamber 48, Lawyers Chamber Supreme Court of India New Delhi - 110001 Subject : Your legal notice dated October 09, 2019 in respect of article published and appeared on our website titled "Indiabulls - LVB merger hinges on a dozen NOCs - Pending investigations delay Reserve Bank nod" and our reply dated October 11, 2019 Dear Sir, 1. Please note we discussed the captioned matter with your client namely Indiabulls Housing Finance Limited to explore settlement. 2. It may be noted that it was inadvertent on our part. Further, as discussed and agreed during our meeting, the matter stands settled between your client and us. 3. Under these circumstances we request you to kindly withdraw the said notice dated October 09, 2019. Yours sincerely, For Business Standard Private Limited" 46. The above-referred shows that pursuant to legal notice issued by the respondent- Indiabulls, the Business Standard has acknowledged that the information given by them was inadvertent and without any premise. The Business Standard has offered settlement for making false allegations against the respondent-Indiabulls. 47. The categoric stand of respondent-Ministry of Corporate Affairs is that inspection under Section 206(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 in respect of three companies i.e. IBVL, IBHFL and IBREL was directed on 23.07.2018 and as per Inspection reports dated 15.11.2019 and 19.11.2019, the loans given by IBHFL to five companies, i.e. DLF, Americorp, Vatika, ADRG, Chordia, which is the subject matter of the present writ petition, have been repaid and the loans given to the other entities, i.e. Vatika and Chordia, are reported to be 'Standard Accounts' and the remaining issues/violations reported in the Inspection Report were under examination. The final inspection reports in respect of Indiabulls were submitted to the Central Government on 15.11.2019 and 03.02.2022 and in respect of Indiabulls Real Estate limited, reports were submitted to the Central Government on 28.01.2020 and 03.03.2022. These reports were also shared with SEBI, NHB and State Government of Haryana. 48. The respondent-SEBI has in crystal clear words taken the stand that the loans advanced by the Indiabulls or its subsidiaries or group of companies fall under the purview of National Housing Board and Reserve Bank of India. In turn, the respondent National Housing Board (NHB) in its Affidavit has stated that even though its powers stand transferred to RBI w.e.f. 09.08.2019, however, since it had granted certificate of registration to the Indiabulls to carry on the business of housing finance institution, in its powers under Section 33 of the NHB Act, a special audit of IHFL only was conducted by M/s Ravi Ranjan & Co. LLP, (Chartered Accountants), and not other companies mentioned in the writ petition. 49. The Auditor of NHB has in its report stated that Myrina Real Estate Private Limited, had received funds from Prabhudas Liladhar Financial Services Private Limited (secured against equity shares of IBREL, IHFL, Infosys Limited and Edelweiss Financial Services Limited), Kotak Mahindra Investment Limited (secured against equity shares of IBREL & Edelwis Financial Services), JM Financials Product Limited (secured against equity shares of IBREL and Infosys Limited and other AG companies, including Indialand Tech Park Private Limited and Americorp Capital Private Limited. 50. The Auditor has also reported that loans given to five Reliance ADAG Companies (ADAG), namely, Reliance Big Entertainment Pvt. Ltd., Reliance Communications Enterprises Pvt. Ltd., Reliance Interactive Advisors Private Limited, Reliance Inceptum Pvt. Ltd & Zapak Digital Entertainment Ltd. and that two other ADAG companies, namely, Reliance Capital Ltd. & Reliance Corporate Advisory Pvt. Ltd. by the IHFL, have been repaid by the ADAG Companies. The Auditor also reported that loans advanced to Chordia group, Built to Live Realty LLP and Mahalunge Land Developers LLP and other ten companies; loan of twelve accounts was 'NIL'. 51. Similarly, the Auditor of NHB in its report has stated that out of the twenty three loans sanctioned to Chordia Group of Companies, twelve accounts were "Nil", payment was reflected on 31.03.2018 to Kumar Urban Pvt Ltd. and Delioitte however, no payment was made to Indiabulls Pvt Ltd. 52. The Auditor's report further suggested that 198 loans were advanced by IHFL to 52 Vatika Group entities and three of it, were fully repaid by Vatika Group to IHFL as on 31.03.2019 and some of the loan accounts were nill as on 31.12.2019. Out of fifty two companies, one company, namely, Aspire Promoters Pvt. Ltd. did not have any outstanding. Besides ADPL, i.e. Agnes Developers Private Limited, who had further invested amount in Karkinos Construction Private Limited and India Best Buy Private Limited, had fully repaid the loan. 53. Hence, the Auditor's report of NHB speaks a volume that necessary investigations and inspections were carried out pertaining to the financial accounts of the companies belonging to the Indiabulls group of companies and in most of the cases, the loans advanced by IBHFL stood repaid and for the remaining, the investigation was in progress. 54. The petitioner has also relied upon a letter dated 28.07.2019 written by Dr. Subramanian Swamy to the Prime Minister in respect of alleged embezzlement of amounts by Indiabulls and his tweets in this regard. The respondent-Indiabulls is stated to have preferred CS(OS)475/2019, against Dr. Subramanian Swamy, which was dismissed as withdrawn on 11.10.2019, however, this Court vide order dated 13.09.2019 had passed interim directions to remove/ take down the offending false messages from their portals. 55. What is relevant to note here is that petitioner has also relied upon a hype created in news reports on filing of a writ petition filed by Abhay Yadav (W.P.(Crl.) 20710/2019) in the Hon'ble Supreme Court, however, according to respondent- Indiabulls the said present petition was withdrawn by him on 13.06.2019 i.e. within two days of filing it and the present petition is a copy-paste version the said petition. Infact, Abhay Yadav, in his letter dated 13.06.2019 written to the Hon'ble Prime Minister and other Ministers, had stated that "he had no knowledge of the contents of the complaint and does not know anything about Indiabulls or its promoters, directors, officers etc. and has not drafted any such complaint. He was asked to sign bulk documents and had no knowledge of its contents." The complainant, Abhay Yadav, also stated that he disown the complaint and requested that the same be discarded as false and frivolous. 56. In his another letter, Abhay Yadav, while seeking his withdrawal of his vakalatnama, he stated that through newspaper publications he came to know that one case was filed in his name in the Supreme Court against Indiabulls of companies though he had never met the AoR Ms. K.R. Chitra and the complaint has been filed on false and fabricated documents, by using his name, address and signatures, for their personal gain. 57. Attention of this Court was drawn to the a certificate issued by Hitesh Aggarwal and Chartered Accountants, who has furnished complete status of transactions of loans (Annexure A-7) advanced and repayments made by different companies with Indiabulls, which shows that Americorp Group, Reliance ADAG and DLF Group has no outstanding loan as on 26.09.2019 and Vatika Group has outstanding loan of Rs.639.11crores and Chordia Group has Rs.574.34 crores. 58. Also, in the additional Affidavit dated 04.10.2023 filed on behalf of respondent- Ministry of Corporate Affairs, it is stated that loans provided to these group of companies have been examined and were found to be standard. Further investigations into the affairs of the Built to Live Reality LLP is in progress. 59. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Vishal Tiwari Vs. Union of India & Ors. 2024 SCC OnLine SC 15, while dealing with a batch of petitions in February 2023, under Article 32 of the Constitution , raising concerns over the precipitate decline in investor wealth and volatility in the share market due to a fall in the share prices of the Adani Group of Companies, which was purportedly caused by a report published on 24.01.2023 by an "activist short seller", Hindenburg Research, wherein it was alleged that the Adani group manipulated its share prices and failed to disclose transactions with related parties and other relevant information in violation of the regulations framed by SEBI and provisions of securities' legislation, observed as under:- "34. This Court does have the power under Article 32 and Article 142 of the Constitution to transfer an investigation from the authorized agency to the CBI or constitute an SIT. However, such powers must be exercised sparingly and in extraordinary circumstances. Unless the authority statutorily entrusted with the power to investigate portrays a glaring, willful and deliberate inaction in carrying out the investigation the court will ordinarily not supplant the authority which has been vested with the power to investigate. Such powers must not be exercised by the court in the absence of cogent justification indicative of a likely failure of justice in the absence of the exercise of the power to transfer. The petitioner must place on record strong evidence indicating that the investigating agency has portrayed inadequacy in the investigation or prima facie appears to be biased. 35. Recently, in Himanshu Kumar v. State of Chhattisgarh, this Court, speaking through one of us (JB Pardiwala, J) relying on a judgment of a three judge Bench of this Court in K.V. Rajendran v. Superintendent of Police CBCID South Zone, Chennai reiterated the principle that the power to transfer an investigation to investigating agencies such as the CBI must be invoked only in rare and exceptional cases. Further, no person can insist that the offence be investigated by a specific agency since the plea can only be that the offence be investigated properly. The Court held as follows: "49. Elaborating on this principle, this Court further observed and held as under:- "17. ... the Court could exercise its constitutional powers for transferring an investigation from the State investigating agency to any other independent investigating agency like CBI only in rare and exceptional cases. Such as where high officials of State authorities are involved, or the accusation itself is against the top officials of the investigating agency thereby allowing them to influence the investigation, and further that it is so necessary to do justice and to instil confidence in the investigation or where the investigation is prima facie found to be tainted/biased." 50. The Court reiterated that an investigation may be transferred to the CBI only in "rare and exceptional cases". One factor that courts may consider is that such transfer is "imperative" to retain "public confidence in the impartial working of the State agencies." This observation must be read with the observations made by the Constitution Bench in the case of Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights, West Bengal (supra), that mere allegations against the police do not constitute a sufficient basis to transfer the investigation. 52. It has been held by this Court in CBI v. Rajesh Gandhi, 1997 Cri LJ 63, that no one can insist that an offence be investigated by a particular agency. We fully agree with the view in the aforesaid decision. An aggrieved person can only claim that the offence he alleges be investigated properly, but he has no right to claim that it be investigated by any particular agency of his choice. 53. The principle of law that emerges from the precedents of this Court is that the power to transfer an investigation must be used "sparingly" and only "in exceptional circumstances". In assessing the plea urged by the petitioner that the investigation must be transferred to the CBI, we are guided by the parameters laid down by this Court for the exercise of that extraordinary power." (emphasis supplied)" 60. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Vishal Tiwari Vs. Union of India (Supra), held as under:- "73. Before concluding, we must observe that public interest jurisprudence under Article 32 of the Constitution was expanded by this Court to secure access to justice and provide ordinary citizens with the opportunity to highlight legitimate causes before this Court. It has served as a tool to secure justice and ensure accountability on many occasions, where ordinary citizens have approached the Court with well-researched petitions that highlight a clear cause of action. However, petitions that lack adequate research and rely on unverified and unrelated material tend to, in fact, be counterproductive. This word of caution must be kept in mind by lawyers and members of civil society alike." 61. Applying the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court to the case in hand, this Court is of the opinion that the allegations levelled by the petitioner are not substantiated as these are not supported by any evidence. The balance sheets or other material placed on record is already available on the website of these companies and is thus already in public domain. Not only a large portion of alleged loans were repaid by the respondent-companies but also the loans were advanced against mortgages and securities furnished by the borrowers. Moreover, due to alleged complaints, the Government functionaries have already set in motion and necessary inspections have been carried out by NHB. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs is also in the process of further investigation. 62. In the considered opinion of this Court, due to articles published in magazine and newspaper, the tweets made by member of the petitioner-firm or a Member of Parliament, the share holders of accused-companies were jolted and they were made to suffer huge losses. It is settled position of law that the jurisdiction of investigation lies within the realm of investigating agency and a Court has no authority to interfere in the investigation until and unless there is grave miscarriage of justice or misuse of process of law. The investigation has to be transferred to CBI or SIT or any other agency only in exceptional cases and not as a matter of routine. There is no dispute to the position that necessary investigation in the present case has already been carried out by NHB and also the Ministry of Corporate Affairs is in the process of further investigation. 63. Finding no merit in the present petition, it is accordingly dismissed. Pending applications are disposed of as infructuous.
